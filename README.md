Sphere Studio
=============

Sphere Studio is a powerful .NET-based integrated development environment for
Sphere game development with an interface inspired by Visual Studio.  It sports
many features that the original editor lacks, such as single-step debugging and
plugin support, and is fully compatible with both minisphere 3.0+ and the
original Sphere 1.x "Vanilla" engine.

Using Sphere Studio, you can quickly build Sphere games with the provided
editors.  The IDE includes a comprehensive set of editors for game development,
including a powerful code editor with Quick Find and Replace support, map and
spriteset editors, and more.  And single-step debugging is supported with
compatible engines, allowing you to easily debug your game's JavaScript code.

If you need additional functionality, the editor has a powerful plugin system
which allows any kind of feature to be added by writing a plugin in C# or
VB.NET.  The possibilities are endless!
